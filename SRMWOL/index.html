            <h2>What is Web Development ?</h2>
            <p>Web development itself and how it is done has changed greatly over the years, but one thing has remained the same: web development is about creating applications which run in a web browser.
            <br>
                Some of those applications have most of their logic living on a web server which renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an application. <br>
                
                Other applications only utilize the server to create their initial state, download the logic to run the application, and then use the server only to retrieve and store data.
                
            <br>    Regardless, though, of how web development is done, the basic technologies are the same: HTML, JavaScript, CSS—and a large amount of patience.
                
            <br>    Web developers today utilize about every major programming language to create web applications. To name a few of the most popular web development languages in no particular order:
                 
                
                Python (that includes Django, the Python web development framework)
                Java
                ASP.NET
                C++
                C
                Scala
                Ruby
                 </p>

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <div class="HTML">
            
            <img src="images/h.png" alt="html">
            <p> <br>
                This is the keystone of web development. All web development must contain some HTML, because HTML is the basic building block of the web.

                You can build an entire web application using just HTML—although it won’t really do that much (and I’d probably call it a web page).
                
                HTML, or (Hypertext Markup Language), is used to specify the format and the layout of a web page.
                
                HTML consists of a series of tags that define the parts and components of a web page.
                
                For example, you might use the <img> tag to embed an image on a page.
                
                A web browser will parse the HTML and use it along with CSS and JavaScript to render a page.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <div class="CSS">
            
            
            <img src="images/c.png" alt="">
            <p>          Before CSS existed, HTML was used to both specify the format of a web page as well as to dictate how it should be displayed and styled.

                This was a problem because it meant that in order to change the styling of a web application— for example, to make all the buttons a different color—the HTML would have to be changed in many places in the application.
                
                CSS was invented to solve this problem by cleanly separating the content of a web page from the styling of it (although the two do overlap from time to time).
                
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be linked to in a web page in order to define the styling for that web page.
                
                
                
        </div>
        <h3>JavaScript(JS)</h3>
        <div class="JS">
            
            <img src="images/js.png" alt="">
            <p>          When JavaScript first came out, it was a bit of a novelty that was used to do some very basic things on web pages, but JavaScript has evolved to take a much more central role in web development.

                At its heart, JavaScript is a fully-functional dynamic language which can be executed directly in the web browser.
                
                JavaScript makes web pages more interactive and allows for programmatic manipulation of web pages and their content.
                
                JavaScript can directly interact with the DOM of a web page, which is its underlying structure.
                
                
                In web applications, this all happens inside of the browser .</p>
